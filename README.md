# Game Night
I have wanted to do a little more real programming and the problem I really have is not knowing what to do.

During this whole pandemmic, I realized how mush I missed going to my mom's house for game night and though it would be really fun if I could host a game night now that we are dispursed geographically.  I don't want to solve the communications issue - the phone companies did a really good job and now Facebook, zoom, discord, you name it has really stepped up and made that issue go away.

But they don't (currently) have a way for us to play those games.  So I am going to build it!
Card Games:
  Michagan Rummy
  Rummy
  Gin
  Go Fish
  Old Maid
  Kings Corner
  Blitz (oh, that is going to be fun!?!)
  Spoons!!!!! (LOL - we broke a table playing that game!)
  Hand and Foot
  Canasta
  Poker
  Black Jack
  MORE!
We could play a ship tageting game - I heard there is a patent depending on the name, but not the actual sinking of ships by calling out a co-ordinate
Chess
Checkers
Chinese Checkers
Strateg-ish
Bingo

There are so many things to do here, this gets rid of my "coders" block (writers block?)
